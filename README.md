### Running the game
1) `npm i` - first install dependencies  
2) `npm start` - just start the webpack and dev server

### Features
- gui
- shaders
- scenes
- loading
- saving
- stats

- Game preloader

### TODO:
- ~~Routing~~
- Rename game container? Add second scene
- ~~Use store for storing some data across scenes~~
- Eject from create-react-app
- Set up dev/prod environmental builds
- Deploy to Zeit's `now` to share your experiments with folks
